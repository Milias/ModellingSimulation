# Week 3: Monte Carlo simulation of Hard disks in the NVT ensemble

In this week assignment, two and three dimensional systems are considered; rectangular and hexagonal lattices in two dimensions, and simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices in three dimensions.

1. To generate all the data, execute ./week3.sh
2. To generate the 2D representations, both still pictures and animations, use python/graphs.py and uncomment relevant lines.
3. To use visual-python to visualize 3D data, use python/graphs.py as well and change the relevant file names.
