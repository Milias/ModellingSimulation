# Modelling and Simulation weekly exercises

## Week 1: Introduction

1. Compute the first N prime numbers.

## Week 2: Random walks

1. Compute Pi using a hit and miss method.
2. Simulate random walks and compute average distance squared from the origin.

## Week 3: Monte Carlo simulations

1. Simulate hard spheres' movements in a system with periodic boundary conditions for several initial configurations: rectangular and hexagonal lattice in 2D, simple cubic and face-centered cubic in 3D.
