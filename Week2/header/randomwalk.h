/*
  Tbis class defines several methods used to compute
  random walks, as well as <R^2(N)> and saving results
  to disk.

  Among the attributes we can find a random number
  generator from the standard library (usually an
  implementation of the mt19937 algorithm), several
  information variables and two C arrays of size
  StepNumber to store R(N) and <R^2(N)>.

  Random walks can be p√®rformed with or without periodic
  boundary conditions, by setting a BoxSize larger
  than zero.
